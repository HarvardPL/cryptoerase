Prototype compiler for cryptographic enforcement
of language-based information erasure
================================================
http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/accrue.html

The Accrue Interprocedural Java Analysis Framework (Accrue) is a
framework for interprocedural analysis of Java programs, implemented
as a Polyglot compiler extension (see
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/polyglot/). This prototype compiler
for enforcing information erasure using cryptography is builds on a
number of analyses from the Accrue project.

This directory contains the following sub-directories:

  - src: Source directory of the prototype compiler
  - rt-src: Source directory for the erasure runtime
  - sig-src: Signature files for libraries. These are currently
             incomplete.
  - bin: executables for launching the compiler
  - lib: Contains jars of necessary dependencies including
         Polyglot and Accrue
  - tests: Unit tests
  - examples: A sample application built using the compiler

Disclaimer
----------

Accrue is research software. Over time, some of the interfaces in the
framework may change.  This may require some clients of the framework
to be changed to conform to the new interfaces.  Also, Accrue is not
well documented.  If you use Accrue, we'd appreciate you letting us
know. Please send comments and bug reports to Stephen Chong at
chong@seas.harvard.edu.

Requirements
------------

Java 1.6 or later, ant.

Building cryptoerase
---------------

From the root directory, execute ant. Run "ant -p" for a description
of build targets.

Using the compiler
----------------

To compile a program using the cryptoerase compiler, invoke the
shell script "cryptoerasec" in the bin directory.
